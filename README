Project Euler notebook format:

    File naming:
        Initial filename is [problemID].ipynb   
        
        If you want to retry a problem, create a new notebook entry with name [problemID]_[retryNumber].ipynb
        
        when solved, add "s" prefix to name (?) - alternatives are moving to separate folder, and suffixing "(solved)"
            
        if discarded, add "d" prefix to name (?) - alternatives are moving to separate folder, and deleting without leaving a trace
    
    
    Inside notebook entry, try to include these sections:
    
        1. Title of problem, link to problem
        2. Problem statement block (best if in my own words - but a direct screenshot can work)
        3. "Planning"/outline block (it can be blank, or be done retroactively, honestly)
        4. [work]
        5. Solution block
        6. "Learning" block (it can be blank, honestly)

        (thanks to Dr. Deng for introducing to me this kind of organization ideal)

    If you want to remember the things you learned, compile and organize your links and topics at the bottom of the project
